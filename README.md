# spotify-info


To run for yourself, create an app on Spotify's dev page and create a file called `authentication.json`

It should contain:
```
{
    "username": "YOUR SPOTIFY USERNAME",
    "redirect-URI": "http://localhost/",
    "client-ID": "YOUR CLIENT ID",
    "client-secret": "YOUR CLIENT SECRET",
    "user-token": "THIS IS AUTO GENERATED"
}
```
